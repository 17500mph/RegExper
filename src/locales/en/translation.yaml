  <0>Regexper and the tools used to create it are all open source. If you are
  concerned that the JavaScript being delivered is in any way malicious, please
  inspect the source in the <1>GitLab repository</1>.</0>

  <1>There are two data collection tools integrated in the app. These tools are
  not used to collect personal information:</1>

  <2>
    <0><0>Google Analytics</0> is used to track browser usage data and application performance.</0>
    <1><0>Sentry.io</0> is a tool used to capture and report client-side JavaScript errors.</1>
  </2>

  <3>Regexper honors the browser <1>“Do Not Track”</1> setting and will not
  enable these data collection tools if that setting is enabled. Also, most
  popular ad blockers will prevent these tools from sending any tracking data.
  Disabling or blocking these data collection tools will <3>not</3> impact the
  performance of this app. The information collected by these tools is used to
  monitor application performance, determine browser support, and collect error
  reports.</3>

  <4>Regexper is not supported by ad revenue or sales of any kind.</4>
